My portfolio is where I get to showcase my journey and growth as a web developer. It allows me to display the projects I'm most proud of, all in one place. Other than that, it provides me the freedom to fully express my aesthetic interests (like the absolutely unhinged background). It is a place which I will likely be continuously improving and adding new features. 

I initially designed it on Figma, then went on to develop it in Laravel, using Blade as the templating engine for its incredible efficiency when paired with Laravel, and Tailwind for I am in love with the incredible efficiency in writing code with it. Later on I added a functional carousel, and used Inertia to be able to work with ReactJS.  

I am extremely excited to see this portfolio grow with each new project I decide deserves its spot in here. 
Upcoming feature: Dark/Light mode with React and Tailwind. Currently, color theme adapts to your browser or OS's color preferences.
